# GrowFitness

# Overview:
- Our application is a fitness optimization website. Specifically, this web app differs from traditional fitness websites through its implemented solution. Instead of the typical "design a workout", then save and upload it; our service has the user input what workout routines they already
follow. The site will then make background calculations to recommend exercises that the user should be doing in order to optimize their personal fitness routine. This is different from group Gamma, which is doing an "upload and share" social platform for fitness plans without having an exercise routine recommender system. Again, the main emphasis on our solution is to optimize total body fatigue instead of just becoming a repository for different workouts. Our site also allows users to focus on standard growth patterns 
while ignoring features that facilitate interations between users like: comments, likes, posts and shares. Our way of tracking fitness has no similar solutions currently, which makes this idea a unique approach to the entire model of 
exercise and fitness.
