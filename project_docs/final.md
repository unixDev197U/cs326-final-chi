# GrowFitness

# Overview:
- Our application is a fitness optimization website. Specifically, this web app differs from traditional fitness websites through its implemented solution. Instead of the typical "design a workout", then save and upload it; our service has the user input what workout routines they already
follow. The site will then make background calculations to recommend exercises that the user should be doing in order to optimize their personal fitness routine. This is different from group Gamma, which is doing an "upload and share" social platform for fitness plans without having an exercise routine recommender system. Again, the main emphasis on our solution is to optimize total body fatigue instead of just becoming a repository for different workouts. Our site also allows users to focus on standard growth patterns 
while ignoring features that facilitate interations between users like: comments, likes, posts and shares. Our way of tracking fitness has no similar solutions currently, which makes this idea a unique approach to the entire model of 
exercise and fitness.

# UI:
- The landing page for the website is a pre-login home page which the user can look over the web application and see the different description of the project. The website has a login/registration page to sign in/register to the account. From their the user is moved to the profile page that gives a summary of the user. Then they can add exercises and see what is recommended by moving to the add exercises page to add to the account.

# APIs:
- Create: The create endpoint for our project creates a new user with no exercise volume and default values for non-required parameters. 
- Read: The read endpoint for our project reads the user data 
- Update: The update endpoint for our project updates the object with user data 
- Delete: The delete endpoint for our project delete the object

# Conclusion:
- Our team found this an interesting Group Project to work on. With the effects of COVID-19 it was impossible for our group to come togeather and work on the project, as a result the production cycle had to be extended longer in order for us to make our checkpoints in development. Having a better understanding of typescript as well as back-end implementation would have been extremely useful beforehand. During the design process we learned a lot about the development pipline and for most of the team this was our first time working on a collaborative project this grand. Learning to develop the full stack was also an invaluble experience during the development process.
